# Mobile-Architect-and-Programming

  In my app I wanted to create something that would help people keep track of important events in their lives. Or even just help someone that needded a reminder every day. I wanted the user to be able to add events that they think are important in their life. They will be able to have the app set as a one time event, or daily or weekly. However they want it set, and then they can have the event notify them whenever it is that day, or a certain time that day.

  I wanted my UI design for my app to be simple and non-distracting. I had my login screen with the name of my app on it, so there isnn't much to look at except seeing the name. Then there is the main activity which is your events page. In this page it gives all your events, plus it gives you the date of the events, and you can delete or edit the events to your liking. Having only the information that your user needs on the screen helps them with the use of your app.
  
  I had trouble when it came to the coding of my app. I read a lot and still can't figure out how to get my program to add the events whenever the user inputs the information that they want. I was able to get the login to work, but I couldn't get the login data to be stored in the database.
  
  My final design is different from what I began with, because I made my intial idea more complex than what my coding skills could handle at the moment. My goal is to keep learning and to try and make my intial idea. There is always room for improvements when it comes to apps, so by starting out simple it will give me a good idea of where to start.
  
  I figured out the UI design pretty well. I was able to create multiple screens and they all have different layouts, this gave me a good idea on what all needed coded.
